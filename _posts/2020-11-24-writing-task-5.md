Aggressive (aggro) decks in Magic the Gathering (Magic or MtG) are decks that favor aggressive fast paced strategy. The goal of an aggro deck is to get an opponent's life total down to zero as fast as possible. Their strength lies in keeping their opponents off balance, and knocking them down quickly. Their weakness is they run out of steam if the game drags on. Here is the basic strategy behind aggro decks.
 
## Deckbuilding
When building an aggro deck the most important thing is to keep it focused. An aggro deck's entire strategy is to kill their opponent as fast as possible, and they don't have room for anything that doesn't align with that goal.

### Colors
Typically in aggro decks you want to have as few colors as possible. The more colors in the deck the more likely it will be you won't have the required mana to cast your spells. It is important to note that more colors can open up more options, but in that case it is extremely important to have a strong mana base to support those colors. 

### Mana curve
The mana curve in aggro decks should be as low as possible, as the lower your curve the more likely you are to curve out.

The following is a table for the average amount of cards for each CMC in aggro deck with 20-23 lands:

| Converted Mana Cost | number of cards |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 8-12 |
| 2 | 8-12 |
| 3| 8-12 |
| 4 | 4-8|

### Creatures
Aggro decks are typically characterized by playing a lot of creatures quickly. Aggro decks like to try and overwhelm their opponent by the number of creatures, i.e. threats, they need to deal with.
Creatures in an aggro deck should typically follow these characteristics,
* Low mana cost
* High damage
* Hit fast

*Here are few cards that work well in an aggro deck.*

### Removal
Removal is an important tool for an aggro deck to have, as it allows an aggro deck to eliminate blockers and get in more attacks. Burn spells are particularly good in this case as if they aren't being used to remove blockers they can be used to directly damage your opponent.

## Game strategy
The actual turn by turn tactics is relatively simple, focusing on presenting threats quickly, and dealing as much damage as they can.

The following are key tactics to use while playing Aggro.
* Attack as much as possible.
* Disrupt your opponents.
* Close out the game quickly.

## Conclusion
Aggro decks are powerful strategy in Magic, their strength coming from the sheer speed. But it is important for them to remain focused and effective, and keep the pressure on. Nonetheless, they are fun and entertaining to play, so good luck and have fun smashing face.
