Remaining secure on the internet may not be as hard as it seems. Passwords are the primary way of remaining secure on the internet, but most people use ‘1234567’, or ‘password’ as their passwords. Regardless of the strength of your password reusing it is an issue. But how can you secure your accounts? Well, let’s explore some of your options.

## 2-Factor Authentication

One of the biggest ways you can secure your accounts is to enable 2-factor authentication. 2-factor authentication works by requiring another way of identifying yourself. The three factors of authentication are the following:
* Something you know, such as a password.
* Something you have, such as a bank card.
* Something you are, such as your fingerprint.

The more factors of authentication you use to identify yourself, the harder it is for someone to gain access to your accounts.

## Password Managers

To be truly secure on the internet, every account you have should have a long, complex, and unique password. However, due to the limitations of your own memory, this isn’t a feasible option for most people, enter password managers.

Password managers work by taking all of your accounts and creating a unique password for them and then put those passwords into encrypted storage. The encrypted vault can only be accessed by a master password that you set (Which should be as strong as possible, remember that length is the greatest strength). Once you have logged in to the password manager it can then fills in your other accounts’ passwords, allowing you easy access to your accounts while making them more secure.

The following are a few password managers you can use:

## How do they affect you?
Now while all these extra steps can be annoying, and can make it slower to get into your accounts. In exchange, you can greatly improve your level of security. However, you no longer need to worry about remembering every single password you create. Both password managers and 2-factor authentication are reliable and secure ways for keeping your accounts safe.

## Conclusion 
 
In conclusion, use the tools at your disposal to be secure and be smart about how you interact with the web. Your personal information is extremely valuable, so take the time to ensure it is secure and private. For as much the little extra hassle they cause 2-factor authentication and password managers are extremely effective at what they do.
