I am Adam Isaak, an 18 year Canadian living in Winnipeg. I’m currently enrolled at the Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology working towards a diploma in software development.

Ever since I got my hands on my first video game I’ve been hooked.  But I didn’t just want to play them, I wanted to know what made them tick, how they work, and how they are designed and engineered. I wanted to know every little facet.

On a more personal note I am that guy with a million hobbies. From running Dungeons and Dragons every week, to jamming out on the guitar or bass, I’m always up to my nose in some hobby or another. It’s important to always have fun and remember to make time for the little things.
